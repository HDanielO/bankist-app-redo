# Bankist -REDO

This project is an independent re-implementation of the "Bankist" application, originally featured in Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course. My primary goal in undertaking this project was to solidify my understanding and practical application of core JavaScript concepts, particularly:

  * **Arrays:** Advanced array methods (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `find`, `findIndex`, `some`, `every`, `flat`, `flatMap`, `sort`, `forEach`, `from`).
  * **Numbers:** Working with numerical data, including `toFixed`, `parseInt`, `parseFloat`, `Math` methods, and handling large numbers.
  * **Dates and Times:** Utilizing the `Date` object, formatting dates and times, and implementing timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`).

## Project Overview

Bankist is a simulated online banking application that allows users to log in, view their transaction history, transfer money, request loans, and close their accounts. This solo re-creation focuses on implementing the underlying logic and user interface without direct reliance on the original course's code.

## Technologies Used

  * HTML5
  * CSS3
  * JavaScript (ES6+)

## Features Implemented (or to be Implemented)

  * User login and authentication
  * Displaying account movements (deposits and withdrawals)
  * Calculating and displaying account summaries (incomes, outcomes, interest)
  * Transferring money between accounts
  * Requesting loans
  * Closing accounts
  * Implementing a logout timer
  * Sorting account movements

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I aimed to achieve a deeper understanding of:

  * Structuring and organizing JavaScript code.
  * Manipulating the DOM efficiently.
  * Handling user input and events.
  * Applying array methods for data transformation and analysis.
  * Working with dates and timers for dynamic UI elements.
  * Debugging and problem-solving independently.
